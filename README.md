# 🐍 My Python Journey

Hi! I’m Ronnel, an Electronics Engineer with 8+ years in healthcare technology.
I’m transitioning into Data Engineering, focusing on **healthcare data** (e.g., patient test results, instrumentation logs).

This repository documents my Python learning journey. It contains:
- 📒 **notes/** — Daily or weekly logs of what I study
- 🛠 **projects/** — Mini, practical projects tied to real data tasks
- 📈 **monthly_progress/** — Monthly recaps of skills, projects, and plans

## How I use this repo
1. Each study session → add a new Markdown note in `notes/` using the template.
2. Each mini-project → put code/notebooks in `projects/` with a short README.
3. End of month → write a summary in `monthly_progress/2025-08.md`.

> Tip: Keep entries small and consistent. Even 10–15 minutes of notes builds a great portfolio over time.
