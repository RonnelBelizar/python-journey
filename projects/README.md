# Projects

Mini, practical projects that reflect real tasks.

Suggested starters:
- **patient_data_cleaning.ipynb** — Clean raw CSV of patient tests, handle missing values, standardize columns.
- **tb_test_summary.py** — Count positives/negatives/errors by age group or site.

Each project should include:
- Short description of the goal
- Input data format (anonymized / synthetic)
- How to run
- Output sample (CSV/plot/printout)
