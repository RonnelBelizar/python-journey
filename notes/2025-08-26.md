## 📝 Topic

What I studied today:  

1. I went back to Bro Code's tutorial and made some exercises such as temperature conversion, etc.

2. Validation with conditions.

3. I also learned format specifiers today.

4. I compared two version of the while loop.

5. I did a bank interest exercise.


## 💻 Code Example

```python

# Converting input temp to C or to F

unit = input("Enter unit (C/F): ")
temp = float(input("Enter temperature: "))

if unit == "C":
    result = (temp * 1.8) + 32
    print(f"Temperature = {round(result)} F")
else:
    result = (temp - 32) * 0.555
    print(f"Temperature = {round(result)} C")

# validate user input exercise
# 1. username is no more than 12 characters
# 2. username must not contain spaces
# 3. username must no contain digits

while True:

    user = input("Enter username: ")

    if user == "exit":
        break

    def rule():
        print("""
            1. username is no more than 12 characters
            2. username must not contain spaces
            3. username must not contain digits
            """)

    # rule() if len(user) > 12 or " " in user or not user.isalpha() else print("Granted!")

    # Another script:

    # rule() if len(user) > 12 or not user.find(" ") == -1 or not user.isalpha() else print("Granted!")

    # or,

    # rule() if len(user) > 12 or " " in user or any(char.isdigit() for char in user) else print("Granted!")

# format specifiers

price1 = 12345.34
price2 = -6665.345234
price3 = 7431.3321

print(f"Price 1: {price1:+,.2f}")
print(f"Price 2: {price2:+,.2f}")
print(f"Price 3: {price3:+,.2f}")

# + means adds "+" if value is positive
# , means adds "," if value is thousand
# .2f means rounding value to 2 decimal places. f means float

# 1st version of while loop

name = input("Enter Name \"exit\" to quit: ")

while name != "exit":
    print("Your name is", name)
    name = input("Enter another Name \"exit\" to quit: ")

#... rest of the code

# 2nd version of while loop

while True:

    name = input("Enter Name \"exit\" to quit: ")

    if name == "exit":
        break

age = input("Enter age: ")
# ... rest of the code

# 🏦 Bank Interest Exercise
#
# Write a Python program that:
# 1. Asks the user for:
#    - Initial deposit (P)
#    - Annual interest rate (in %, convert to decimal)
#    - Number of times interest is compounded per year (n)
#    - Number of years (t)
#
# 2. Use the compound interest formula:
#       A = P * (1 + r/n) ** (n * t)
#       I = A - P
#
#    Where:
#       A = Final amount (principal + interest)
#       I = Interest earned
#
# 3. Print out the final amount and the total interest earned.


initial_deposit = float(input("Enter initial deposit: "))
interest_rate = float(input("Enter interest rate in %: "))
interest_rate_dec = interest_rate / 100
num_interest = int(
    input("Enter number of times interest is compounded per year: "))
years = int(input("Enter number of years: "))

final_amount = initial_deposit * \
    pow((1 + interest_rate_dec/num_interest), num_interest * years)
int_earned = final_amount - initial_deposit

print(f"Final amount: P {final_amount:,.2f}")
print(f"Interest earned: P {int_earned:+,.2f}")

```


## 🔍 Reflection 

- What clicked:  

    -   Usage of while loop, ternary conditional expression (where if statement is done by a single line).

    -   Two versions of while loops work equally as intended but on slightly different formats.

- What confused me:  

    -   Some new scripts like: 
        -   " " in var
        -   var.find()
        -   any(var.isdigit() for var in input)
            -   Especially this one bec. this is new to me — so this basically means it checks a data when it satisfies at least one, it returns a value of True.

- How I connected it to healthcare data:  

    -   I think format specifiers are helpful because machine logs have a different types of numbers to be processed for different types of reasons.

## 🎯 Next Step

    I am going to continue with Bro Code's tutorial. Time stamp is 2:03:58.
