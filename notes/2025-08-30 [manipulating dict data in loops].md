1. Concession Stand Exercise
    - Utilized loops
    - Dict data manipulation
        - Store, write, pull

## üíª Code Example

```python
# Concession Stand Simulator ‚Äî Exercise
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Your task:
# Build a console program that simulates a concession stand
# where customers can order food items, pay, and receive change.
# The program should also keep track of sales and inventory.
#
# Features to implement:
# 1. Menu (dict: item ‚Üí price)
# 2. Inventory (dict: item ‚Üí quantity)
# 3. Place orders (loop until customer is done)
# 4. Check inventory before confirming an order
# 5. Compute total cost of an order
# 6. Accept payment and calculate change
# 7. Update inventory after a sale
# 8. Print a receipt
# 9. Track sales for the day
# 10. Show daily summary at the end
# -------------------------------------------------------

## üîç Reflection

- What clicked:  

    - Loops and dict data manipulation.

- What confused me:  

    - Nested loops can sometimes be confusing.

- How I connected it to healthcare data:  

    - This could be useful as there are tons of health care data to be manipulated.
