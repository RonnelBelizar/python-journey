Today marks my official documentation of my Python journey. I have tried learning it for
the past couple of days and I decided that it will be much better if
I start documenting it for my reference.

I've studied a Youtube Video "Python Full Course For Beginners [2025] by Programming with Mosh"

and I finished the free content and now I'm moving on to "Python Full Course for Free by Bro Code"

## 📝 Topic

What I studied today:  

I performed exercises based from my previous video tutorial that I've tried to study from. I asked ChatGPT to
make sample problems from the summary of the video and I answered some problems.

I also made a script for healthcare-like data.

## 💻 Code Example

```python

```

## 🔍 Reflection

- What clicked:  Reiteration of all the codes I've been doing for the past couple of days.
- What confused me:  Some codes like when and where you set a variable especially when looping is a bit confusing.
- How I connected it to healthcare data:  These are definitely used in healthcare. I found it helpful.

## 🎯 Next Step

Proceed to few more exercises.
