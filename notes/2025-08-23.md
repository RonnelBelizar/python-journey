Today marks my official documentation of my Python journey. I have tried learning it for
the past couple of days and I decided that it will be much better if
I start documenting it for my reference.

I've studied a Youtube Video "Python Full Course For Beginners [2025] by Programming with Mosh"

and I finished the free content and now I'm moving on to Python Full Course for Free by Bro Code

## 📝 Topic

What I studied today:  
(basic print command)

## 💻 Code Example

```python
print("Hello World!")
print("""
    Hi! My name is Ronnel
    """)
```

## 🔍 Reflection

- What clicked:  It's the same basic code with other programming language I used before (PIC Microcontrollers)
- What confused me:  
- How I connected it to healthcare data:  Basic data printing

## 🎯 Next Step
