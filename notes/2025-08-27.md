I've done a couple of exercises today

1. fizz buzz
2. palindrome checker
3. reverse words in a sentence
4. student gradebook system exercise (extremely hard for me atm)

## 💻 Code Example

```python

# Reverse Words in a Sentence.

text = "data engineering is cool"

split_text = text.split()

rev_text = " ".join(split_text[::-1])

print(rev_text)
# Expected output is "cool is engineering data"


```

## 🔍 Reflection

- What clicked:  

    - The usage of 
        - var.split()
            - This converts a string into a list.
        - " ".join(var)
            - This combines a list with a " " forming a single string.

- What confused me:  

    - var.split() and " ".join(var)
        - Only at first because this were new to me.

    - The entire exercise student gradebook system is hard for me to take right now — not because I do not know entirely what to do, but the loops within loop and a dictionary within a dictionary confuses me.
    Also, I haven't learned yet how to combine dictionaries and there are some codes that's new to me.
        - for var in var.items():
            - I cannot explain it right now because my head hurts from this activity.

## 🎯 Next Step

    I'm going to continue with this exercise tomorrow. Time stamp on BroCode is 2:17:44.
