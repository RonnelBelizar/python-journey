What I studied today:  

I made a code for a TB Clinic Data Log uploaded on my healthcare data exerrcises folder. It was a combination of looping, counters, creating a dictionary, and printing a summary of results. 

## 💻 Code Example

```python
# Example code I tried
name_counter = 0
mtb_counter = 0
xdr_counter = 0
senior_num = 0
cash = 0
insurance = 0

patient_data = []


while True:

    if name_counter != 5:
        name_counter += 1
    else:
        break

    name = input("Enter patient name: ")
    age = input("Enter age: ")
    diagnosis = input("Enter diagnosis (MTB/XDR): ")
    payment = input("Enter payment (Cash or Insurance): ")

    patient = {
        "name": name.title(),
        "age": int(age),
        "diagnosis": diagnosis.upper(),
        "payment": payment.title(),
    }

    patient_data.append(patient)

print("Total patients: ", name_counter)

for record in patient_data:
    if record["diagnosis"] == "MTB":
        mtb_counter += 1
    else:
        xdr_counter += 1

    if record["age"] >= 60:
        senior_num += 1

    if record["payment"] == "Cash":
        cash += 1
    else:
        insurance += 1

print("--- Summary ---")
print("Total patients: ", name_counter)
print("MTB patients: ", mtb_counter)
print("XDR patients: ", xdr_counter)
print("Number of seniors: ", senior_num)
print("Cash payments: ", cash)
print("Insurnace payments: ", insurance)
```

## 🔍 Reflection

- What clicked: 
    The previous lessons I've learned. 

- What confused me:  

    Looping sometimes confuses me because I
    sometimes mess up when and where to put variables. Also,
    I just learned some codes how to deal with dictionaries - how to use the data in it as a reference to a code.

- How I connected it to healthcare data:  

    This is processing like an actual data from a TB Clinic.

## 🎯 Next Step

    Maybe more exercises.
